# WikiWare
gurt

^ my beloved gurt will not be removed.


# Installation
Install Wikiware by git cloning the project, via
`git clone https://github.com/superintendent2521/wikiware.git`
Then, after it is completed,
`cd wikiware`
Install your requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
It requires bleach, which is technically out of date and unsupported however nothing else exists that would match its functionality without me making it myself and i dont have much time anymore. so im stuck with out of date shit lmao
