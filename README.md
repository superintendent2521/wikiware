# WikiWare
gurt

^ my beloved gurt will not be removed.


# Installation
Install Wikiware by git cloning the project, via
`git clone https://github.com/superintendent2521/wikiware.git`
Then, after it is completed,
`cd wikiware`
Install your requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
It requires `bleach` for HTML sanitization. While this library is not actively maintained, it remains a necessary dependency for security until a suitable modern alternative is implemented.
