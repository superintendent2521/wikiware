            <ul>
                <li><strong>How do I create a new wiki page?</strong> Use the "New Page" button on the dashboard.</li>
                <li><strong>How do I edit an existing page?</strong> Click the "Edit" link at the top of any page.</li>
                <li><strong>Who can view my pages?</strong> By default, pages are public, we plan to have the ability to have private pages, however it is not high on the list as it isnt really designed for it.</li>
                <li><strong>Why is version history store the most recent page as the lowest number?</strong> This is a design choice to make it easier to find the latest version quickly. to rollback to the version before it, you go to version 2, which then after a rollback is now version 3 and 1.</li>
            </ul>
