# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Anything running past the `prod_v2` branch (including main after it was merged) is able to recieve security fixes, vulnerabilitys found before that will not be fixed unless it still affects versios past that.


## Reporting a Vulnerability
Either report it on github here, or DM it to me on discord, my username is `.superintendent`

if you are able to get RCE/access to accounts without proper authentication, report them to both routes. including your python verson, your mongo version, and your fastapi
